RKE2 RANCHER cluster on vsphere with Terraform
This project automates the deployment of a RKE2 on vsphere using Terraform, with Rancher installed for Kubernetes management.

The structure of this project, including Terraform modules and configuration, is adapted from the Rancher Quickstart.

The created vm will be accessible over SSH using the root user and password linux.
